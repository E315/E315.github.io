## Piazza

We will be using Piazza to host a course forum.  You are encouraged to read this
regularly and post technical questions as it will be a significant source of
help and hints on the projects. We do not answer technical questions via email.
To save everyone time, we want all students to have the benefit of
seeing each question and its answer, so please use the forum. We prohibit
posting your own solutions, project code, test cases, or output to the forum.

## Autograder

We will partially grade your programs in an autograder system that is similar to
the Linux environment. Your code must be submitted, compile, and run correctly
on the autograder to receive full points. We use a web-based autograder for code submissions. 

Note that for security reasons, the autograder website is only accessible from within the IU network.  Therefore, you must either be on campus or connected through a VPN to access the website.
